tablejs
=======
a table data structure for fast access in both dimensions. Thoroughly unit tested (the tests are included). This code should have nearly identical behavior to the Java code in the `table` repo. The js tests are run by pointing a browser at tabletest.html. The script takes a really long time to run, so your browser may complain of a "busy script on this page".

This code was originally in the `useful-packages` repo, but I decided to break it up.
